Planned responsibilities:
- Maintain internal knowledge: seen cells, known free cells.
- Perceive (update visibility), Plan (choose path with selected search), Act (move one step).
- Metrics tracking (steps, replans), path_taken list.

Next steps:
- Define Metrics dataclass.
- Implement OnlineAgent with step() and run() methods.
- Implement exploration strategy when goal path is unknown (frontier-based).

"""Experimental OnlineAgent for development in experiments/ahsan.

This agent is intentionally kept in experiments so it can iterate quickly
without touching `src/`.

Usage: run this module or import OnlineAgent in experiments for manual tests.
It supports two modes:
  - full_map=True: agent has complete knowledge of the map at start (fast testing)
  - full_map=False: agent uses a simple reveal_from implementation that looks up
	neighbors from the Asthar grid and reveals only immediate adjacent tiles
	(simulates fog radius=1). This is enough to implement online replanning.

The agent uses `experiments/ahsan/search.py` functions (bfs/astar) which accept
an agent-provided neighbor function based on the agent's known free tiles.
