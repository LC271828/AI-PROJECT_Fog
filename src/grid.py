"""Grid module (TODO-only scaffold).

Planned responsibilities:
- Load grid from CSV supporting symbols: 0 (free), 1 (wall), S (start), G (goal).
- Provide neighbors() for 4-connected moves.
- Implement fog-of-war visibility around agent position.

Next steps:
- Define a Grid dataclass with cells, start, goal, fog_radius.
- Implement from_csv() parser with basic validation.
- Add helpers: in_bounds, passable, neighbors, visible (Manhattan radius).
"""

# TODO: implement Grid dataclass and helpers as per description above.
