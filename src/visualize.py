"""Visualization (placeholder).

Planned behavior (optional):
- Simple pygame window rendering grid cells, seen area, agent, start, goal.
- Step agent each frame until done or window closed.

Notes
- This module intentionally contains no runtime code yet; the text-based
	visualization lives under examples/visualize_text.py for quick iteration.
